# Non-Inversive Glucometer


To measure blood sugar in a non-invasive way  the IR rays and red light penetrate the skin and the rays interact with the finger tissues and glucose concentration and then are reflected, and this reflected light is an electric current and then it is converted into an electric potential which is detected by photo detector (the module we used here is MAX30100). We were looking for a lot of sensors that read the output voltage. Then we compared the results of the effort with the concentration of blood sugar by the gaseous method and extracted the relationship and then finished the design of the device.



## Installation

### Install library for oled display
- Go to library manager inside tools in arduino ide
- And type

```bash
  SSD1306
```
-  install the SSD1306 library from Adafruit

- type 
```bash
GFX

```
- install adafruit GFX library

### Install library for MAX30100 sensor
- Go to library manager inside tools in arduino ide
- And type   
```bash
  MAX30100lib
```
- install it


## COMPONENT USED

    ```
- jumper wires
- Bread board    
## While using MAX30100 module

want to make change in module 

### Before

## Finally 
- now you can start connecting components as per the circuit diagram
- And start uploading the code to arduino nano
